Phishing has become a major threat to the internet
space by way of phishing emails and websites and its related
crime related casualties increases every year with millions of
dollars lost to scam. Phishers are inventing new ways to entice
internet users to share personal details. To avoid being a victim
of cyber-attack, phishing detection using data mining algorithms
must be implemented to detect website that are phishing or legitimate.
Many machine learning algorithms for phishing detection
has been previously suggested by researchers, some due to the
complex existence of the many phishing schemes used by cyber
criminals, the thirst for a better to the best solution to cybercrime
lingers on. In this project, we proposed a new phishing
detection model based on Tensorflow boosting algorithm. The
experimental outcome revealed that XGBoost and Tensorflow
boosted estimator-based phishing detection model is promising
by returning a test-accuracy of 98% and 95% respectively which
outperformed Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
and Auto encoders that returned test accuracies of 93.4%, 97.2%
and 28% respectively.
